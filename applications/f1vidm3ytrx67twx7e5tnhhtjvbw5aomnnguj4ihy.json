    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Henan Online Course Center aims to promote the transformation of educational and teaching concepts in higher education institutions, guide reforms in teaching content and models, and facilitate a shift from teacher-centered instruction to student-centered learning, from classroom-based teaching to a combination of classroom and extracurricular instruction, and from outcome-based evaluation to a combination of outcome and process evaluation. It encourages deepening the reform and innovation of talent cultivation models. The center promotes universities to leverage their disciplinary strengths and modern educational technologies to build high-quality online open courses that are suitable for internet dissemination and instructional activities, with a focus on cultural quality education courses for college students, widely-enrolled general education courses, and core professional courses, ensuring excellent content quality and teaching effectiveness.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Online Education Courses",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "As a data preparer, the process of preparing data for Filecoin involves the following steps:\n\nData Selection and Aggregation: Data is organized based on client requirements or available datasets, ensuring it meets storage standards and compliance criteria.\nData Packaging: Tools like lotus client deal or venus are used to package the data into a CAR (Content Addressable Archive) file format suitable for the Filecoin network.\nGenerating Unique Identifiers: IPFS or Filecoin tools are used to generate a CID (Content ID) for the data, which uniquely identifies and verifies the content.\nInitiating Storage Deals: A storage deal is created on the Filecoin blockchain, where appropriate miners are selected and storage duration and price parameters are set.\nData Sealing and Verification: Miners \"seal\" the data onto their storage devices and use zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to verify the integrity of the stored data.\nOn-chain Confirmation and Monitoring: Once the deal is recorded on the blockchain, it can be monitored via a block explorer to ensure the storage remains active and valid.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://henan.icourses.cn/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02827953\nf02827843\nf02827109\nf02826602\nf02825675\nf02826762\nf02827135\nf02827010\nf02825281 \nf03610683",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
