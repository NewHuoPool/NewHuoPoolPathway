    "Brief history of your project and organization": "DATADAO is built upon technical expertise and utilizes proprietary programs and advanced tools to provide customized car data packaging services to clients. Our team boasts extensive experience and proficiency in utilizing cutting-edge tools such as go-graphsplit and singularity to ensure efficient and accurate data packaging. Our service process encompasses the following key points:\r\n\r\nTechnical Expertise: Our team possesses rich technical expertise in utilizing advanced tools. By leveraging tools like go-graphsplit and singularity, we ensure the efficiency and accuracy of data packaging. These tools aid us in processing and packaging client-provided data to meet the storage requirements of the Filecoin network.\r\n\r\nData Processing Flow: We employ proprietary programs to segment, package, and compress client-provided data, ultimately generating ZIP files ranging from 28-32GB in size to align with the storage requirements of the Filecoin network. Through these services, we effectively assist clients in processing and preparing data for storage and usage on the Filecoin network.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The 1000 Genomes Project created a catalogue of common human genetic variation, using openly consented samples from people who declared themselves to be healthy. The reference data resources generated by the project remain heavily used by the biomedical science community.\r\n\r\nThe International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) maintains and shares the human genetic variation resources built by the 1000 Genomes Project. We also update the resources to the current reference assembly, add new data sets generated from the 1000 Genomes Project samples and add data from projects working with other openly consented samples.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.internationalgenome.org/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Monthly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02984282 | Zhengzhou, Henan \r\nf02894875 | Nanchang, Jiangxi\r\nf0427989 | Qingdao, Shandon\r\nf02200472 | Chengdu, Sichuan\r\nf02942808 | Jiangmen, Guangdong\r\nf02951064 | Hangzhou, Zhejiang\r\nf01025366 | Qingdao, Shandong\r\nf02951213 |  Singapore",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
